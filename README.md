  - Learn *Products* and *Fraud Types* across the lifecycle. 

- **Review Existing Processes and Tools**
  - Current fraud detection *workflows*.
  - Data *entry and management* procedures. Data storage, governance, retention schedules, sharing, etc.
  - Inter-departmental *communication protocols* for fraud alerts and feedback.

- **Assess Avaiable Data**
  - **Data Sources:** claims data, policy data, customer profiles, payment history, internal investigation reports, etc.
  - **Data Availability and Quality:** missing, duplicate, or inaccurate data, time interval, etc.
  - **Labeling Strategy**.

- **Evaluate Existing Models**
  - **Model Types**: supervised, unsupervised, or hybrid.
  - **Explainability and Interpretability**: accuracy, trustworthy, insights.

- **Identify Gaps and Opportunities**
  - **Scalability**: scalable systems across different business lines.

#### 1.3 **Balancing Exploration (R&D) with Execution (Impact Delivery)**

|             | Explorations (R&D)                                           | Execution (Impact Delivery)                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Goals**   | Investigate new techniques, technologies, and fraud patterns (long-term). | Deliver measurable, business-aligned outcomes (short-term).  |
| **Cycle**   | Monthly or quarterly planning                                | Daily or Weekly planning                                     |
| **Methods** | Explore cutting-edge AI/ML approaches (e.g., GenAI, advanced NLP applications). | Implement well-understood ML techniques, optimize existing rules, improve integration with operations, etc. |
| **Effort**  | 20% ~ 30%                                                    | 70% ~ 80%                                                    |

- Create clear handoff *from R&D to Execution* (e.g. define graduation criteria).
- As stage moves on, more effort can be put on Explorations.



### 2. 60-120-180 Day Plan

#### 2.1 First 60 Days – Learning and Landscape Assessment

- **Goals**
  - Comprehensive understanding of the current fraud landscape.
  - Build relationships and trust.
  - Pinpoint initial opportunities for high-impact, low-effort contributions.

- **Hypotheses to Explore**
  - We can increase fraud detection accuracy using a supervised ML model trained on historical confirmed fraud cases.
  - Unstructured data (e.g., claim notes, adjuster comments) holds untapped signals for fraud detection.
  - Certain rules are triggering too frequently and overwhelming investigators with false positives.

- **Success Metrics**
  - **Model Performance:** Key metrics including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC), with particular attention to performance on the minority (fraud) class, given the typically imbalanced nature of fraud data.
  - **Operational Impact:** Quantifiable measures such as the reduction in false positives (thereby saving investigator time), an increase in the true positive detection rate, a decrease in the average time taken to detect fraud, and estimated cost savings from prevented fraudulent payouts.

  - Design and implement *robust feedback loops*, particularly from model end-users (e.g., investigators), to continuously refine, retrain, and enhance the performance of fraud detection capabilities.



### 3. Technology, Tools, and Technique

#### 3.1 **Modern AI/ML Techniques for Fraud Detection**

- **Supervised Learning**
  - **Techniques:** Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM), Random Forests, Logistic Regression.
  - **Rationale:** These techniques are highly effective for classification tasks when sufficient labeled historical fraud data is available. Gradient boosting methods, in particular, often achieve state-of-the-art performance in fraud detection applications due to their ability to focus on hard-to-classify instances. 

- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - **Techniques:** Isolation Forests, One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVM), Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN).
  - **Rationale:** Essential for identifying novel or unusual patterns that do not conform to known fraud signatures. This is particularly valuable when labeled fraud data is scarce, when dealing with emerging fraud typologies, or for detecting outliers in provider billing behavior.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
  - **Techniques:** Hugging Face Transformers, LLMs (GPT-4 Turbo in retrieval mode).
  - **Rationale:** A significant amount of crucial information in insurance is locked in unstructured text data such as claims notes, adjuster reports, witness statements, customer emails, and even social media posts. NLP unlocks these insights, often revealing nuanced indicators of potential fraud that structured data alone cannot capture.



#### 3.2 Structured vs. Unstructured Data

- **Structured Data**

  Form the foundational layer for most initial fraud models and rule-based detection systems. It is directly consumable by many machine learning algorithms and is used for predictive modeling, developing rules engines, anomaly detection on transactional data, etc.

- **Unstructured Data**

  Unstructured data often harbors rich contextual information and subtle indicators of fraud that are not captured in structured fields. Effectively leveraging this data is a key component of "reimagining" fraud detection and can provide a significant uplift in detection accuracy and the ability to uncover more complex fraud schemes.



#### 3.3 Building a Fraud Model/Scoring System from Scratch

- Problem Definition and Goal Setting
- Data Collection and Preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Selection
- Model Training and Validation
- Thresholding and Scoring
- Interpretability and Explainability
- Deployment and Monitoring
- Feedback Loop and Iteration



### 4. Innovation Suggestion

**Network Analysis** is a method used to study the relationships and interactions between entities (nodes) connected by links (edges). These entities can be people, organizations, accounts, devices, etc., and the connections between them represent interactions like communications, transactions, or shared attributes.

- **Why Network Analysis?**
  - **Increased Accuracy**. Network analysis excels at identifying *collusion rings* and sophisticated fraud schemes.
  - **Improved Speed of Detection**. Once a suspicious entity (e.g., a fraudulent claimant or a collusive repair shop) is identified, network analysis can rapidly *highlight all associated entities and claims*.
  - **Enhanced Operational Efficiency.** Instead of investigators manually trying to piece together disparate data points from various systems, a graph database provides a unified, visual representation of complex relationships.

- **How it works?**

  A policyholder claims an accident involving a repair shop and a medical clinic. Network analysis shows:

  - The same repair shop is involved in 40% of suspicious claims.
  - The same doctor signs off on most of them.
  - All claimants are connected via a social network.

  This clustered activity would raise a red flag for further investigation.
